            <h2 id="aboutme">About me</h2>
                    <p>I was born in New York, New York on 12/9/99.
            I have a wide variety of hobbies such as playing basketball,
            playing cards, and debating against other school in forensics.</p>
                    <p>My Family includes my mom, my two sisters, my stepbrother, and stepdad. 
            We all love to go on vacation but we have different versions of a dream vacation.
            My dream vacation would include going to the beach with all of my family and friends.
            I would like to visit La. The reason why is because I would like to see if it is everything people say it is.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <h3>long term goals</h3>
                    <p>Most of my short term goals take a lot of creatively. One of them is to learn how to draw. 
                    Another one of my short term is to remake my room to a “dream room.”
                    I would like to get my mille time to five minutes and thirty seconds.</p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>Some of my long term goals includes owning a business. Another one would be to live without regrets.  </p>
            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    One of my biggest flaws in education was to truly express myself thoughts through my words and after years of practicing I have finally accomplished this. 
                    I believed I learned how to do this because of my forensics class where I had to create debate to persuade people that you had the better case.
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                    A personal goal that I always wanted to accomplish is losing all of the extra weight that I didn’t want. 
                    I was close to 200 pounds in middle school and now I am almost 150 pounds.
