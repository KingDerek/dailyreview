                    <p>I was born in New York, New York on 12/9/99.
            I have a wide variety of hobbies such as playing basketball,
            playing cards, and debating against other school in forensics.</p>
                    <p>My Family includes my mom, my two sisters, my stepbrother, and stepdad. 
            We all love to go on vacation but we have different versions of a dream vacation.
            My dream vacation would include going to the beach with all of my family and friends.
            I would like to visit La. The reason why is because I would like to see if it is everything people say it is.</p>
